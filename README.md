# geocode_lookup
D8 module which takes entity Address field and populates entity with geocode data from Google. Module is currently very site specific and will need to be tweaked to work elsewhere.

# Instructions
- Valid Google API key required and input into Lookup.php
- Modify field names used
- May also have to change the fields that are used from the Address field so that it works for your locality and to choose the map display for your geo field.
